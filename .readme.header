# Qute

The cutest queue you'll ever meet.

To use Qute, write jobs that implement `Job`, then run `Qute(c, n)` where `c` is a Job channel and `n` is your pool size. For example:

```golang
c := make(chan Job)
n := 10

go Qute(c,n)

// Send job
c <- myJob

// You'll get the same job back when it's done
myJobCameBack := <-c

// Close to gracefully shutdown
close(c)
```
